This repository is a **Persian-language data governance playbook** designed for Iranian organizations.

It provides:

- **Templates** for data request forms, data sharing agreements, and access matrices.
- **Real-world scenarios**, e.g. how a student can request data from a government organization.
- **Short explanations** of open-source data governance tools (OpenMetadata, DataHub, Apache Atlas) and how they might be useful in the Iranian context.
